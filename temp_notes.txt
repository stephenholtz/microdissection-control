Dissection Notes
	laser:
		- after replacing the compressor and a standard 2x refill
		- ~ 13kV -> 9.5mJ, quite stable
	fly:
		- 24-48 hour post eclosion old flies 
		- collected yesterday after clearing the day prior
		- iav-Gal4>10xUAS-GFP, large/healthy female fly
	pre laser dissection:
		- cold anaesthetized, body glued with bondic, front legs removed
		- antennae glued with KOA300
	laser dissection:
		- 1000um round window (was previously using 800um)
		- test cut on head capsule (ROI centring), and then right antenna (pulse count)
		- 190 pulses @ 100Hz w/9.5mJ pulse energy at laser photodiode
	post laser dissection:
		- added warmed, bubbled saline directly after cut by hand
		- rinsed with ~1 volume transfer pipette with saline
		- removed proboscis, ventral air sacs and right antenna
		- opened head capsule, gently removed dorsal air sacs and severed m16
