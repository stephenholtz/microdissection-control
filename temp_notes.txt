Dissection Notes
	laser:
		- refilled laser 
		- ~12.8kV -> 9.5mJ, stable
	fly:
		- collected 3 days ago after clearing 4 days prior
		- R39A11-Gal4>GFP
	pre laser dissection:
		- cold anaesthetized, body glued with bondic, front legs removed
		- antennae glued with bondic also, on lateral and medio-ventral surface
	laser dissection:
		- 800 round window
		- test cut head capsule for ROI centring
		- test cut right and left antenna with same settings
		- 250 pulses @ 100Hz w/9.5mJ pulse energy at laser photodiode
	post laser dissection:
		- added warmed saline directly after cut by hand
		- rinsed with copious saline
