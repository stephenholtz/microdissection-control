Dissection Notes
	laser:
		- refilled laser 8/14/19
		- ~13.5kV -> 9.5mJ, stable @ 200 Hz
	fly:
		- notes elsewhere
	pre laser dissection:

	laser dissection:
		- 800um round window
		- test cut head capsule for ROI centring
		- test cut right and left antenna with same settings
		- 3 seconds dry N2 purge,
		- 350 shuttered stabilization laser pulses
		- 160 pulses @ 200Hz w/9.5mJ pulse energy at laser photodiode
