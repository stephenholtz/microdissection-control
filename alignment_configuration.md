Laser alignment and general configuration notes
===============================================

### Current Stats
- *Max energy* (post-refill 100Hz@15kV): 1.95mJ 
    - [GAM Laser factory measurement: 4.0mJ]
- *Max power* (post-refill 250Hz@15kV): 0.36W
    - [GAM Laser factory measurement: 3.0W] 
- Max energy at sample without aperture: 

### Full Alignment
A "full" alignment of the system involves:
1 - aligning the laser cavity optics / position on table 
2 - aligning mirrors, telescope, and dichroic
3 - setting the UV objective and aperture 
4 - setting the position of visible collection optics (this shouldn't need to change)
5 - co-aligning UV and visible light paths

*1: Laser Cavity and Laser*
- See the GAM documentation for more complete notes
- Remove both front and rear panels to access both mirrors (front mirror is where the beam exits, rear mirror acts as a pick off for closed loop energy mode)
- Use both a white card and the energy meter to get a uniform circle and high energy
